# Fashion Mnist Classification Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset is held by Zalando SE.

This 28x28 pixel dataset contains grayscale images of 10 fashion categories (from T-shirts to Ankle boots) and serves as a baseline for image classification.

In this repository, I created a model to classify these images.
